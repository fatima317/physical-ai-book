# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### Educational Excellence
Content must be structured to guide learners from beginner to advanced levels in humanoid robotics. All materials must include progressive examples, hands-on exercises, and clear learning objectives with measurable outcomes. Rationale: Ensures accessibility and effectiveness for diverse skill levels.

### Hardware/Software Standardization
All implementations must target Jetson NX hardware and utilize ROS 2 Humble, Gazebo, and Isaac Sim for simulation environments. Code examples and tutorials must be validated on this specific stack. Rationale: Maintains consistency and reproducibility across all learning materials.

### Interactive Personalization
All content must incorporate personalization features allowing users to customize their learning path. Systems must support adaptive difficulty, preferred learning styles, and individual progress tracking. Rationale: Enhances engagement and learning outcomes for individual students.

### Multilingual Accessibility
All educational content must be available in English and Urdu with professional-quality translations. Translation systems must maintain technical accuracy and cultural relevance. Rationale: Ensures global accessibility and inclusivity for diverse student populations.

### Technical Verification
All code examples, simulations, and implementations must be verified through multiple authoritative sources. Documentation must include traceable citations to academic papers, official documentation, or industry standards. Rationale: Maintains technical accuracy and credibility of educational content.

### Reproducible Code Quality
All code samples must be complete, tested, and reproducible in the specified environment. Code must include proper documentation, error handling, and follow established best practices for robotics development. Rationale: Ensures students can successfully replicate and build upon examples.

## Interactive Features and Tools

### Subagent Integration
The book must leverage AI subagents for personalized tutoring, code review, and simulation assistance. Subagents must be designed to progressively challenge students based on their demonstrated competency. All AI interactions must be transparent and explainable to students.

### Skill-Based Learning Modules
Educational content must be organized into discrete, testable skill modules. Each module must include clear prerequisites, learning objectives, practical exercises, and assessment criteria. Students must demonstrate mastery before advancing to subsequent modules.

### Simulation and Real-World Alignment
All simulation examples in Gazebo and Isaac Sim must correspond to real-world humanoid robot behaviors. Students must be able to transfer learned concepts from simulation to physical hardware with minimal adaptation required.

## Development Standards

### Source Verification Requirements
All technical claims, code examples, and methodologies must be supported by authoritative sources. Citations must include links to official documentation, peer-reviewed papers, or industry-standard resources. Unverified content must be clearly marked as experimental or theoretical.

### Code Quality and Testing
All code examples must include unit tests, integration tests where applicable, and documentation for setup and execution. Code must follow ROS 2 coding standards and include proper error handling, logging, and safety considerations for robotic systems.

### Reproducibility Standards
Every tutorial and example must include complete setup instructions, dependency specifications, and expected output. Docker containers or similar technologies must be provided to ensure consistent execution environments across different student setups.

## Governance

All contributions to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book project must comply with these constitutional principles. Changes to this constitution require formal review by subject matter experts in robotics education and approval by the project steering committee. All content must undergo technical review by certified robotics professionals before publication. Code examples and simulations must be validated on the target hardware platform (Jetson NX) to ensure accuracy and reproducibility.
