# Code Formatting Skill

This skill provides comprehensive code formatting and standardization for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. It ensures all code examples follow consistent standards while maintaining educational value and technical accuracy.

## Purpose
- Apply consistent formatting to code examples across all modules
- Ensure code follows ROS 2 Humble, Python, C++, and other relevant standards
- Maintain readability and educational value of code examples
- Verify hardware compatibility with Jetson platform constraints
- Include proper documentation and error handling

## Core Components

### Formatting Standards by Language

#### Python (ROS 2 Humble)
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use 4-space indentation
- Include docstrings for all functions/classes
- Use snake_case for variable and function names
- Include type hints where appropriate
- Add meaningful comments explaining complex logic

#### C++ (ROS 2 Humble)
- Follow Google C++ Style Guide
- Use 2-space indentation
- Include Doxygen-style documentation
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Implement proper RAII principles
- Add meaningful comments explaining complex logic

#### Launch Files (Python/XML)
- Consistent parameter organization
- Proper namespace handling
- Clear node naming conventions
- Include documentation for parameters

### Educational Code Standards
- Include setup and initialization code
- Add proper error handling and logging
- Provide clear variable names that reflect their purpose
- Include cleanup and shutdown procedures
- Add comments explaining the educational purpose
- Consider different skill levels (beginner to advanced)

### Hardware Compatibility Checks
- Verify ARM64 architecture compatibility
- Check memory usage constraints for Jetson
- Validate GPU acceleration usage
- Ensure proper power management
- Include thermal considerations

## Code Quality Guidelines

### Structure Requirements
- Proper imports at the top
- Clear separation of concerns
- Modular design for educational clarity
- Consistent naming conventions
- Appropriate use of constants and configuration

### Documentation Standards
- Comprehensive module-level documentation
- Function/class docstrings with parameters and return values
- Inline comments for complex logic
- Example usage in comments
- References to relevant ROS 2 documentation

### Error Handling
- Proper exception handling
- Graceful degradation when possible
- Informative error messages
- Recovery strategies where appropriate
- Logging for debugging purposes

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient algorithms for resource-constrained platforms
- Proper resource management
- Memory usage optimization
- Real-time performance considerations
- Battery life optimization for mobile robots

## Integration Points
- Personalization for different skill levels
- Validation against hardware constraints
- Translation compatibility for comments
- Interactive MDX component integration
- Testing and validation framework integration

## Usage Instructions
Apply this skill to all code examples to ensure consistency, educational value, and hardware compatibility. Review each code snippet against the standards above before inclusion in the book.
