# Week 1 - Introduction to Physical AI

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Define Physical AI and distinguish it from traditional AI
- Explain the importance of embodied cognition in robotics
- Set up your development environment with ROS 2
- Create your first ROS 2 workspace and package

## Foundations

### What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents the intersection of artificial intelligence and physical systems. Unlike traditional AI that operates purely in digital spaces, Physical AI must contend with:

- Real-time constraints
- Physical laws and limitations
- Safety considerations
- Uncertainty in sensing and actuation

### The Embodiment Principle

Intelligence emerges through interaction with the physical environment. This principle drives the design of our robotic systems and influences our approach to AI development.

## ROS Fundamentals

### Setting Up Your Environment

1. Install ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill on Ubuntu 22.04
2. Create your first workspace
3. Understand the package management system

### Basic Concepts

- Nodes and communication patterns
- Topics, services, and actions
- Parameters and configuration

## Key Terms

- **Embodied AI**: AI systems that interact with the physical world
- **Embodiment**: The idea that intelligence emerges from physical interaction
- **ROS**: Robot Operating System framework
- **Node**: A process that performs computation in ROS
- **Topic**: Named bus over which ROS nodes exchange messages

## Learning Checkpoints

### Quiz Questions
1. What distinguishes Physical AI from traditional AI?
2. Name three challenges unique to Physical AI systems.

### Practical Exercise
Create a ROS 2 workspace and write a simple publisher-subscriber pair that exchanges messages containing "Hello Physical AI!".

## Hands-On Exercise

Implement a simple ROS 2 node that publishes sensor data (simulated) and another node that subscribes to this data and prints it to the console.
