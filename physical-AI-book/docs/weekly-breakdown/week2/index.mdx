# Week 2 - Gazebo Simulation Basics

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Launch and configure Gazebo simulation environments
- Create and customize robot models in URDF format
- Implement basic robot controllers in simulation
- Test navigation algorithms in simulated environments

## Gazebo Simulation Environment

### Introduction to Gazebo Garden

Gazebo Garden is the latest version of the Gazebo simulation platform, offering advanced physics simulation and rendering capabilities essential for robotics development.

### Launching Your First Simulation

Learn to start Gazebo with different world files and configure simulation parameters.

## Robot Modeling with URDF

### Understanding URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)

URDF is an XML format used to describe robots in terms of their joints, links, and other properties.

### Creating Your First Robot Model

Step-by-step guide to creating a simple wheeled robot model with sensors.

## Simulation-to-Hardware Transfer

### The Reality Gap

Understanding the differences between simulation and real-world performance.

### Bridging the Gap

Techniques to minimize the reality gap and improve transferability.

## Key Terms

- **URDF**: Unified Robot Description Format
- **Simulation**: Virtual environment for testing robotic systems
- **Reality Gap**: Differences between simulated and real-world behavior
- **Physics Engine**: System that simulates physical forces and interactions
- **Sensors Simulation**: Virtual representation of real sensors

## Learning Checkpoints

### Quiz Questions
1. What is URDF and why is it important in robotics?
2. Name three advantages of using simulation in robotics development.

### Practical Exercise
Create a simple URDF file for a differential drive robot with two wheels and a chassis, then load it into Gazebo.

## Hands-On Exercise

Design a robot model in URDF, spawn it in a Gazebo environment, and implement basic movement controls to navigate through a simple obstacle course.
