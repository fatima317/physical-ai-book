## What is Physical AI?

<PersonalizeChapter skillLevel="beginner" userSkillLevel="intermediate">

<TranslateToUrdu>

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact directly with the physical world. Unlike traditional AI that operates in digital spaces, Physical AI systems must perceive, reason, and act in three-dimensional environments with real physics and real-time constraints.

### Key Components of Physical AI Systems

<PersonalizeChapter skillLevel="beginner" userSkillLevel="beginner">

<TranslateToUrdu>

Physical AI systems typically include several key components:

1. **Sensors**: Cameras, LIDAR, IMUs, and other devices that perceive the environment
2. **Actuators**: Motors, servos, and other devices that enable movement and interaction
3. **Controllers**: The computational systems that process sensor data and command actuators
4. **Learning Algorithms**: AI models that enable adaptation and improvement over time

## Humanoid Robotics Overview

<PersonalizeChapter skillLevel="beginner" userSkillLevel="beginner">

<TranslateToUrdu>

Humanoid robots are designed to resemble and mimic human behavior. They typically have:

- A head with sensors for perception
- A torso that houses computational and power systems
- Arms and hands for manipulation
- Legs for locomotion (in some designs)
