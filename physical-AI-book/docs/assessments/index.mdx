# Assessments

## Assessment Methods

This course employs multiple assessment methods to evaluate student learning across different dimensions:

### Practical Assignments (40%)
Hands-on implementation of robotic systems using the tools and frameworks covered in each module. Students will build, test, and refine real systems.

### Simulation-to-Hardware Projects (30%)
Projects that demonstrate successful transfer of learned behaviors from simulation to physical hardware platforms.

### Final Capstone Project (25%)
A comprehensive project integrating concepts from all four modules, demonstrating end-to-end Physical AI system development.

### Participation and Peer Review (5%)
Engagement in discussions, code reviews, and collaborative learning activities.

## Rubrics

### Technical Implementation
- **Excellent (A)**: Code is well-structured, documented, and follows best practices; system performs reliably with high accuracy
- **Proficient (B)**: Code functions correctly with minor issues; system performs adequately with some limitations
- **Developing (C)**: Basic functionality present but with significant issues; system has notable performance limitations
- **Beginning (D/F)**: Significant issues preventing proper function; system fails to meet basic requirements

### Problem Solving
- **Analysis**: Ability to break down complex problems into manageable components
- **Approach**: Selection and application of appropriate tools and methods
- **Innovation**: Creative approaches to solving novel problems

### Documentation and Communication
- **Clarity**: Explanations are clear and accessible to others
- **Completeness**: All necessary information is provided
- **Professionalism**: Documentation meets industry standards

## Learning Checkpoints

Each module includes multiple learning checkpoints to ensure students are progressing appropriately:

- **Foundation Check**: Basic concepts and tools
- **Integration Check**: Combining multiple components
- **Application Check**: Using knowledge in new contexts
- **Synthesis Check**: Creating novel solutions

## Self-Assessment Tools

Students are encouraged to use self-assessment checklists to monitor their progress and identify areas for improvement.
