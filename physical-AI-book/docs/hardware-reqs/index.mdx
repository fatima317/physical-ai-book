## The Latency Trap

### Critical Timing Considerations

#### Real-Time Performance Requirements
- **Control Loop**: 100Hz (10ms) minimum for stable robot control
- **Perception Pipeline**: 30Hz (33ms) for real-time visual processing
- **Planning Algorithm**: 10-20Hz depending on complexity
- **Communication**: Sub-`1ms` for safety-critical systems

#### Network Latency Implications
- **Local Network**: 0.1-1ms acceptable for most operations
- **Remote Control**: 10-50ms threshold for human-robot interaction
- **Cloud Processing**: 100ms+ may cause perceptible delays
- **Safety Systems**: Must respond in `<5ms` regardless of other loads

#### Buffering Strategies
- **Input Buffering**: Maintain 3-5 frames for smooth processing
- **Output Buffering**: Pre-compute trajectories with safety margins
- **Fallback Modes**: Autonomous safety behaviors when latency exceeds limits

### Testing for Latency
Regular benchmarking of system latency is essential:
- Monitor round-trip times for all critical communications
- Test under maximum expected computational loads
- Verify safety systems remain responsive during peak usage
- Plan for graceful degradation when latency increases
