## Prompt

Create a constitution for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book project.
Include:
- Educational objectives for robotics learners (beginner → advanced)
- Hardware/software constraints (Jetson NX, ROS 2 Humble, Gazebo, Isaac Sim)
- Interactive features (personalization, Urdu translation)
- Subagent & Skill usage
- Source verification requirements
- Code quality and reproducibility
- Clear guidelines for technical accuracy and traceable sources

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive constitution for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book project that addresses all requested elements. The constitution includes:

- Core principles focusing on educational excellence, hardware/software standardization, interactive personalization, multilingual accessibility, technical verification, and reproducible code quality
- Sections on interactive features and tools including subagent integration and skill-based learning modules
- Development standards with source verification requirements, code quality standards, and reproducibility guidelines
- Governance section outlining compliance requirements

The constitution specifically addresses the hardware constraints (Jetson NX, ROS 2 Humble, Gazebo, Isaac Sim), educational progression from beginner to advanced, interactive personalization features, multilingual support (English and Urdu), subagent and skill usage, and requirements for technical accuracy with traceable sources.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created initial constitution file with comprehensive guidelines for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book project
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md with complete constitution
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with project implementation based on constitution
- 🧠 Reflection: The constitution successfully incorporates all requested elements and provides a solid foundation for the educational robotics project
