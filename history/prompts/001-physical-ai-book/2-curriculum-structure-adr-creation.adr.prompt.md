# Curriculum Structure ADR Creation

## Original Prompt
```
/sp.adr curriculum-structure-and-tech-stack
```

## Response Summary
Created ADR-006 documenting the architectural decision for the Physical AI curriculum structure and educational technology stack. The ADR captures the decision to structure the curriculum using a 13-week modular approach with 4 core modules (ROS Fundamentals, Simulation, Perception, AI Planning), using Docusaurus MDX format with integrated code examples and learning checkpoints. The decision clusters educational and technical architecture that works together to deliver the Physical AI learning experience.

The ADR includes:
- Context for the curriculum structure requirements
- The integrated decision covering organization, content format, and technology stack
- Positive and negative consequences of the approach
- Alternative approaches considered with their tradeoffs
- References to related documentation

## Outcome
Successfully created ADR-006 to document the architecturally significant decision regarding curriculum structure and technology stack for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This provides a permanent record of the reasoning behind the educational architecture for future reference and team alignment.
