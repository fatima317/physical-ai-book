# Complete Physical AI Book Implementation

## Original Prompt
```
implement updated task created from updated spec and plan for physical-ai-book
```

## Response Summary
Successfully implemented all requirements for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook as specified in the updated spec. This included:

1. Created comprehensive content for all 4 modules in the quarter overview:
   - Module 1: ROS 2 fundamentals with detailed code examples
   - Module 2: Gazebo & Unity simulation with setup guides
   - Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac Platform with perception systems
   - Module 4: VLA Implementation with Vision-Language-Action systems

2. Implemented complete 13-week curriculum covering:
   - Week 1: Introduction to Physical AI
   - Week 2: Gazebo simulation basics
   - Week 3: Advanced ROS 2 concepts
   - Week 4: Navigation and path planning
   - Week 5: Computer vision for robotics
   - Week 6: Machine learning for robotics
   - Week 7: Human-Robot Interaction
   - Week 8: Manipulation and grasping
   - Week 9: Control systems for robotics
   - Week 10: Perception and sensor fusion
   - Week 11: AI planning and decision making
   - Week 12: Integration and deployment
   - Week 13: Advanced topics and future directions

3. Added all required sections:
   - Why Physical AI Matters
   - Learning Outcomes
   - Assessments
   - Hardware Requirements (with detailed specifications)

4. All content follows Docusaurus MDX format with proper navigation, code snippets, diagrams, key terms, and learning checkpoints.

The textbook is now complete with comprehensive coverage of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, from foundational concepts to advanced implementation techniques.

## Outcome
The Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook has been fully implemented with 13 weeks of detailed content, all required modules, and comprehensive technical coverage. All functional requirements from the spec have been met.
